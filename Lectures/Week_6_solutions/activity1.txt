With a partner, investigate and explain how each of the following might work in communicating over the network:

File Transfer
	
Email
	
Web Page
	

For each scenario, think about and try to explain each of the following:
Who is the client
	? The server?
What does the request look like? The response?

What work does the client do? The server?

What is being communicated?
