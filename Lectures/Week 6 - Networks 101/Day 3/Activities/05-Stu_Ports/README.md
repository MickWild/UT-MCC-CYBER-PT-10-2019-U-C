# Wireshark Port Identification Activity

In this activity, you will open up and look at two PCAP files using mystery protocols. For an extra challenge, disable the "protocol" column before starting.

* This activity will be completed by analysing the following pcap files:
   * [Ports1PCAP](ports1.pcap)
   * [Ports2PCAP](ports2.pcap)

   
## Instructions

   * For each PCAP file, answer the following:

      * Who is the sender? What port is the sender using?

      * Who is the receiver? What port is the receiver using?

      * What protocol is being used?

      * Investigate and write a sentence or two about the purpose of the protocol and how it works. See if you can identify individual steps in communication associated with the protocol.
