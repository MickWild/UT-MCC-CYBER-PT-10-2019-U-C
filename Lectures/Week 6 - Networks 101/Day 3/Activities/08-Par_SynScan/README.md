# Syn Scan Activity

### Instructions

   * For each of the ports 80, 443, and 113, filter the traffic by that port number and answer the following:
      * What protocol is associated with that port?
      * Who is sending the SYN packet?
      * Did the recipient acknowledge the request?
      * What does the response likely mean for whether that port is accessible and/or accepting connections? (use your knowledge of the handshake!)

   * Open the “Conversations” window (`Statistics -> Conversations`), and sort the conversations by the packets column (packet count), descending.
      * Based on what you see here, what other ports might be open, closed, or inaccessible? What protocols are associated with those ports?
      * Who seems to be doing the syn scan?
