### Random Password Lists

* In this activity, you will generate a list of 100 random passwords using the `secrets` module and push each individual element into an external file.

* This is a challenging activity, it is highly encouraged to work with partners or small groups. 


**Instructions:**
    
* Import both the `secrets` and `string` libraries into the application.

* Create a string that will hold all of the ASCII characters and digits inside of it.

* Create a connection to an external text file called **PasswordList.txt**.

* Create a loop that will run for 100 iterations and will push a new, 10 character password of random letters/numbers into the external file.
