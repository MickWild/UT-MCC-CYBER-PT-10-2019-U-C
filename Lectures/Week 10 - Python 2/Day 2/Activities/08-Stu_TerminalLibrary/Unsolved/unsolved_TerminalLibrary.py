# Create an application that will ask the user for the name of a text file.

# Then checks to see if the file exists in the Books folder.

# If the text file exists, then print the text inside of the file to the terminal.

# If the text file does not exist, then print "Sorry! That book is not in our records! Please try again!"

# Hint: When the user enters the file name, keep in mind that they will not use a file extension (.txt).
# Therefore, when you’re creating your file path, remember that you’ll need to have the file extension added to that user input.
