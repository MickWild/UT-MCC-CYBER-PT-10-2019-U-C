## Get Wrekt!

* In this activity, you will be taking on the role of a hacker. The task as the hacker is to overwrite the hard work of your victim with the phrase "GET WREKT!"

* The application the students are making is intentionally dangerous. If this program is run in a careless or malicious manner, it could cause serious damage to a person's computer. Students should make sure their application is walking through the correct paths BEFORE they add the `file.write()` function into their code.

* **Files:** [Diaries.zip](Diaries.zip)

* **Important!**
    
  * Do not run this application inside any important folders that you don't want to be overwritten. Overwriting the text within files like this is serious business. So make sure that your application only walks through the **Diaries** folder before adding the `file.write()` function in.

  * Should you feel nervous about running this application, you can replace the `file.write()` function with `file.read()` instead. This way the program will only read in the data stored within the files instead of overwriting anything.

* **Instructions:**

* Unzip the folder.

* Create an application that will check the **Diaries** folder that you just unzipped and automatically navigates through all of its subdirectories and files.
        
  * Have the application print out the current root that the application is walking through.
         
  * Have the application print out all the folders within the current root.
         
  * Have the application print out all the files within the current root.

  * Have your application automatically connect to each of the text files stored within this folder system and replace their text with the phrase "GET WREKT SKRUB!"

* **Bonus:** Open your browser and locate and download an image. Then move the file into one of the folders within the **Diaries** folder. Run the application again and see what happens to the image file.
