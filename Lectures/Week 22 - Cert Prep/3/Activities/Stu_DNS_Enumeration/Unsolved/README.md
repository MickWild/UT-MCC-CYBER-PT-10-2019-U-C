## Student Activity: DNS Enumeration

In this exercise, you'll play the role of a **security analyst** responsible for auditing the security of Mega Corp One's name servers.

- Mega Corp One recently migrated its name servers and needs to verify that zone transfers are disabled on all of them.

- You are tasked to perform DNS enumeration against `megacorpone.com` to determine what information is publicly available.


### Instructions

Complete the following tasks:

- Install `whois`.
  - Type: `apt install whois` 

- Determine the net range and name server addresses of `megacorpone.com`.

- Identify the IP address of any name server that allows zone transfers.

- Finally, use Netcraft to enumerate subdomains of `megacorpone.com`.


Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help when you get stuck.
