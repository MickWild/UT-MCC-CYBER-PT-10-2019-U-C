- What is the difference between a virus and a worm?
  - [ ] A worm can spread without human interaction, whereas a virus must be downloaded or executed by a user.
  - [ ] A virus can infect multiple computers, but a worm can only infect one at a time.
  - [ ] A virus can copy itself perfectly, but worms change every time they copy themselves.
  - [ ] Worms are used for DoS, while viruses can be used for many things.

- Which type of malware is most associated with spearphishing?

  - [ ] Virus
  - [ ] Trojan
  - [ ]

- Which part of a computer does a bootkit infect?
  - [ ] NIC
  - [ ] Master Boot Record
  - [ ] BIOS
  - [ ] Files

- Which part of a computer does a Windows rootkit infect?
  - [ ] NIC
  - [ ] Master Boot Record
  - [ ] BIOS
  - [ ] Files

- Which ring does a kernel rootkit run in?
  - [ ] Ring 0
  - [ ] Ring 1
  - [ ] Ring 2
  - [ ] Ring 7

- Why are rootkits difficult to detect?
  - [ ] They are usually very small and hard to find.
  - [ ] Anti-Virus can't find them because they only execute in RAM.
  - [ ] Their code is obfuscated and hard to identify as malicious.
  - [ ] They can bypass nearly all security controls because they run with full `root` privileges.

- Which technique do viruses use to spread through Microsoft Word and Excel documents?
  - [ ] Cluster Infection
  - [ ] Multipartite Infection
  - [ ] Macro Infection
  - [ ] Fast Infection

- Which infection method is used by viruses that spread as fake PNG files?
  - [ ] File Infection
  - [ ] Latent Infection
  - [ ] Cluster Infection
  - [ ] Hoax infection

- During which phase of infection does a virus identify places to infect?
  - [ ] Infection Routine
  - [ ] Search Routine
  - [ ] Payload Delivery
  - [ ] Anti-Detection Routine

- Which of the following might happen when a virus runs its Trigger Routine? Check all that apply.
  - [ ] Uninstall itself.
  - [ ] Communicate with a CC server.
  - [ ] Trigger the Anti-Virus scanner to see if it will be detected.
  - [ ] Encrypt the disk so users can't access their data.

- Which of the following can be used to generate trojans? Check all that apply.
