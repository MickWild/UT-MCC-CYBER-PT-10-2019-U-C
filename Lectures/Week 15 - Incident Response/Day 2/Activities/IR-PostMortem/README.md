### **Instructions**

- In this exercise, you find a recent news article about a security incident that was handled poorly and fill in a post-mortem template (to the best of your ability with information you're able to find online). You will use the article and any other materials you can find online to find failures with the incident response plan and pull out some "lessons learned". You can either work in pairs or by yourself for this next activity.

- Find a recent news article that covers a security incident.

- Fill out the post-mortem questions below. If you are unable to answer the question in full, do some further research online. If you are unable to find more information it might be internal company information and feel free to skip the question or make an educated guess as to what may be the answer or what may have happened.

- To see an example of a more detailed post-mortem, read through [Atlassian's Post-Mortem Guide](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/postmortems#blameless-postmortems).

- If you don't have a recent incident or breach in mind, head over to [Cyber Security Hub's Incident of the Week site](https://www.cshub.com/content-hub/incident-of-the-week) which highlight an incident each week, including [Yahoo's 2019 $117.5 million settlement and incidents that led to it](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-multiple-yahoo-data-breaches-across-4-years-result-in-a-1175-million-settlement) or [a biometric security platform breach exposing credentials and biometric information](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-passwords-and-biometrics-info-for-one-million-users-exposed-in-biostar-2-data-breach).
