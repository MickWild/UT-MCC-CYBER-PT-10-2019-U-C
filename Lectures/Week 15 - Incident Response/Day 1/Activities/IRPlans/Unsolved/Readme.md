## Student Activity: Interpreting IR Plans

In this activity, you will compare and contrast four incident response plans from different companies across different sectors and industries.

Do not get overwhelmed by the volume of these documents. As mentioned in the instructions, focus on each document's **table of contents**  and **one section** of your choosing to compare across the documents.

### Setup

**Access the documents at the following links:**

- [National Cyber Incident Response Plan](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/ncirp/National_Cyber_Incident_Response_Plan.pdf)
- [Carnegie Mellon Incident Response Plan](https://www.cmu.edu/iso/governance/procedures/docs/incidentresponseplan1.0.pdf)

- [Virginia Tech Incident Response Plan](https://security.vt.edu/content/dam/security_vt_edu/downloads/incident_response.pdf)

### Instructions

- Write down the type of institution or industry that each of these IR plans belong to.

- Compare the table of contents for each document:
  - Which sections do most of the documents have in common?
  - Which sections are less universal across all plans?
  - What did you find interesting or potentially useful and why?

- Pick one of the sections that each of the plans had in common. Review the content across each of the plans.

- Prepare a short summary of the section and include the following information:
  - What content is found in the section?
  - What value would the section provide during an incident?
  - Who is the primary audience for the section?
