## Solution Guide: Review Interpreting IR Plans

### Solutions:

- What type of industry / institution did each organization below to?

    - Homeland Security: **National Government**

    - Carnegie Mellon: **University (Private)**

    - The State of Oregon: **State Government**

    - Virginia Tech: **University (Public)**

- Compare the table of contents for each document. Which sections do most of the documents have in common?

     **Common Themes and Sections Include:**

    - Introduction, Purpose and Scope

    - Authority, Training, and Definitions

    - Preparation, Detection and Containment

- Point out that while there are several common sections, these plans are quite distinct, each with unique topics to fit their individual needs.

    **Less Common Themes Include:**

    - Executive Summary, Document Structure, Audience

    - Insider Threats, Communications, Private Sector

    - Access Control, Forensics, Escalation

- Ask what the students found interesting or potentially useful and why.

   **Answers may vary**:

    - The fact that all four plans are so different could be enlightening.

    - Many of the plans talk about the CIA triad by mentioning the 'Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability' of systems

- **National Government (Homeland Security)**

    - This document is meant to be a framework, not a tactical or operational plan.

    - Many departments follow this plan including The DOJ, FBI, NCIJTF, and DHS

    - This plan has a 'Guiding Principles' section that affected parties should follow.

    - This plan also distinguishes between "Cyber Incident" and "Significant Cyber Incident"

- **University (Carnegie Mellon)**

    - Carnegie Mellon has an entire "office" that is responsible for creating and maintaining document.

    - It describes an "Event" as any exception outside normal operations.

    - Mentions both PII and PHI

    - Carnegie Mellon calls their Analysts "Incident Response Handlers"

- **State Government (Oregon)**

    - The Oregon State plan seems less official than the Nation Plan.

    - Students may find it interesting to know that there is a `CISO` position for the state of Oregon (and other states), responsible for state-wide information security.

    - Oregon State also has a position called an 'Incident Commander' that seems to resemble a SOC Analyst role.

    - Oregon keeps a full-time 'Enterprise Security Office'(ESO) on staff who's primary focus is on Analysis, but not detection of incidents.

- **University (Virginia Tech)**

    - VT has a check list to follow for Incident Handling.

    - Addresses some very specific attacks, such as botnet DDoS attacks and Ransom Attacks.

    - Includes a chart of changes that occurred to the document.

Go around the room and ask a few students to present their summary and continue to emphasize just how different each Incident Response plan is.
