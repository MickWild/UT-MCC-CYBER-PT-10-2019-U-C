## Solution File: Who Is Tracy Texting? Review

#### Review Guide

* Use the student instruction file to review the process followed in the exercise.

* Check that all students were able to view the messages. 

Complete these steps:

1. Use the File search to find the sms database.

2. View the messages in the **Data Content** pane.

3. Analyze the text messages and phone numbers to establish any connections to the case, and answer the following:
- What is Terry's phone number?
  - Solution: `(703)829-6071. This is evident because she talks about her dad multiple times and Tracey informs her she cannot afford private school anymore.`
- What is Pat's phone number?
  - Solution: `(571)308-3236. The text message refers to Tracey as sis, and a response message shows Tracey calling her brother by his name "pat".`
- What was the fraudulent number that texted about a gift card? Is it relevant to the case? Why or why not?
  - Solution: `(206)910-0932. Although messages can be disgused through text messages, in this instance this is not the case. Looking at the website link that was sent with the message, this text message was spam.`   

4. Update your Evidence Worksheet with any additional evidence.
