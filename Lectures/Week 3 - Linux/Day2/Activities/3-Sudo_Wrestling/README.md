# Sudo Wrestling

Many job interviews will have you complete a technical interview. The following activity is designed to show case your knowledge about authentication logs, and your critical thinking skills. 

**Scenario**

Working at our security firm we deal with many clients. Recently, one of our clients has reached out because their Network Intrution Detection System identified access to their server from a different country. They have passed you the following log file and have asked you to investigate this attack. 

- [Log File](./Resources/auth.log)


**Objectives**

Using terminal (**Mac**) or Git Bash (**Windows**) identify the following about the attack:

- Determine which user's account has been compromised

- Identify which user was attempting `sudo`

- What command did the compromised user try to run as sudo?

- What advice would you give your client about dealing with the compromised account? What command would you use? What if the account that was compromised hasn't been used in years? How would you remove it?
