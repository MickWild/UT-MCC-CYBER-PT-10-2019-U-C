- Type `sudo snort -r <pcap file> -c /etc/snort/etc/snort.conf` to play the downloaded .pcap through Snort.

- Bring up another Terminal window and navigate to `/var/log/snort`

- Review the `alert` log and take note of what appears to be in the pcap, if anything. 

- Clear out the `alert` log and any additional files in `var/log/snort`

- Repeat the replay for the other .pcap files you downloaded.
