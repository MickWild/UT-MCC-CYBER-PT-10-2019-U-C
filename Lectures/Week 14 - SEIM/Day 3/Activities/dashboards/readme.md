## Create a Dashboard for Failed Password Attempts Activity

### Instruction: 

In this activity, you will create a **Failed Password Dashboard** for monitoring login attempts on *Windows* systems for a SOC team. 

You will be using the `wineventlogs_baseline.csv` file for this activity.

You will add the existing `Windows failed login` search to the dashboard.  You will also need to add three other different visualizations of your choice, each visualization should have a different search query.

  - Hint - Use the field of `subject` to look for other fields of interest.
  
     For example, create a visualization for the field of `An attempt was made to reset an accounts password`

Finally, you will `edit` the dashboard to allow for quick  and easy viewing by the SOC team. 

Be sure to be able to explain why you selected the visualization in your Dashboard
