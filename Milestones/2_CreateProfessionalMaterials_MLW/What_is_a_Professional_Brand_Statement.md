# **What is a Professional Brand Statement?**

To be employer competitive, your job search materials and your interview performance need to be aligned to your most relevant and valuable skills. Employers do not want to hear vague statements— they want to hear specifics and see evidence of your skills and accomplishments. When you provide this specific and clear detail, you help them understand what kind of employee you will be, and how you will add value to their team.

The Professional Brand Statement specifically relays your professional identity and provides a direct, clear, and concise introduction to employers. You will also use this statement to help you develop an elevator pitch that you can use at networking events or in informational interviews.

Create your Professional Brand Statement by reflecting on your background and skills.

# **What Makes a Strong Professional Brand Statement?**

The Professional Brand statement should be no more than **75-150 word**s and should touch upon key elements that showcase what makes you a top candidate for a potential employer. The professional brand statement should **always be adaptable**. It can and should be trimmed or expanded depending on the purpose, audience, and platform on which it appears (e.g resume, LinkedIn, website, email, networking documents).

# Employers are typically looking for the following three things.

1. **Technical Skills**
   1. Do you know how to do the job? How have you demonstrated your skills?
2. **Workplace Strengths**
   1. How do you do the job? Do you have strong interpersonal skills? (teamwork, collaboration, communication, learning, problem solving)
3. **Passion**
   1. Do you love what you’re doing? Have you displayed evidence of that passion?

# **PAST | PRESENT | FUTURE**

Frame your professional brand statement in terms of the past, present and future. Your brand statement should communicate where you have been, where you are now, and where you want to to go.

Below are a series of questions to consider. **You do not need to submit this form**, but instead, you should use these questions to brainstorm about your past, your present, and your future.

# **Step 1: Your Past**

Review your work and education history. Think about your **major accomplishments** and the **skills** you have built over time. Bullet out a few ideas here. For example, make notes if you have worked two jobs at once or worked your way through college— both examples are evidence of a strong work ethic and the ability to juggle competing priorities successfully. Think through all your past experiences for similar strengths.

# **Step 2: Your Present (Focus on the Bootcamp)**

Think about yourself now and your current skills from a technical perspective— things you’ve learned how to do in the Bootcamp. What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at doing? List all the things you are good at doing, and then list all the things you love doing. Notice where there are overlaps and gaps.

- **I am good at...** 

  - penetration testing

  - analyzing web vulnerabilities

  - teaching computer science 

  - writing unit tests

    Ex: analyzing and responding to cyber security events.

- **I enjoy...**

  - troubleshooting coding errors

  - analyzing vulnerabilities in the code

  - writing new application

  - teaching

  - helping people

    Ex: troubleshooting to diagnose and isolate common network issues.

# **Step 3: Your Present (Focus on who you are)**

Now think about your strengths as an employee and as a team member. These are strengths that are a reflection of your personal attributes (For example, calm under pressure, very organized, a great communicator, a quick learner, infectious optimism.). Some of these ideas may overlap with your answers to Step 2. That’s okay - the point is to brainstorm here.



# **Step 4: Your Future**

What job are you seeking? What would you love to be doing after you graduate? Jot down a few bullets here.  

# **Step 5: Your Brand Statement**

Use this exercise of reflection on your past, present, and future to summarize 3-4 major points (accomplishments, strengths, passions, skills and personal attributes) that you think should be reflected in all of your job search materials (bio, resume, LinkedIn, website)? What key attributes reflect who you are, what you are able to do, and what you are passionate about?

**NOTE:** After summarizing 3-4 major points, draft a professional brand statement in resume friendly language. Use the Brand Statement Guide, samples, and resources available to evaluate how you have 

done.
